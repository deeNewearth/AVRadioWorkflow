        "post_content": "<p><br></p><p>During the recent lockdown a few of us have come together to clean the beaches near Auroville. We have formed a group called \"Sea Ploggers\", Plogging is a Swedish term which means picking up garbage while jogging or exercising.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from cleaning the beach we also meditate together with the rising sun. We chant hymns and mantras together. We also do yoga and gymnastics on the sand.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a movement started by people who love the ocean and want to protect it.</p><p>We hope that this consciousness will grow, especially in India where governments and NGOs have been pretty ineffective in safeguarding our waters from garbage.</p><p>We are also engaging with the fishermen there and urging them to join us. Over time they have started appreciating our work. Sometimes they too come and help.&nbsp;</p><p>We are currently working at the Bommayarpalayam beach.</p><p>The Bommayarpalayam beach is slowly turning into a beautiful, safe and happy place.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>It's almost like a miracle. For if you remember it was not a very nice place to visit.&nbsp;</p><p>A little virus has finally made us realise that humanity has been going on the wrong path altogether. We feel some divine power is urging us to change.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Please come and join us and be a part of this miracle and this change.&nbsp;</p><p>To join our whatsApp group please send me your name to 9442341398.</p><p><br></p><p>With lots of love</p>"
